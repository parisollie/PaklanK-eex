I am currently developing a prototype that will contain 4 things:

   *An application prototype for engineering faculty students.
   
   *A database to sell products.
   
   *A Web application and a web page to promote the application for the UNAM engineering faculty.
   
   *A TIC project management project, related to this.

The app can do the following things at the moment:

  * It has an interactive menu to order.
  * Can recognize QR codes.
  * It has an interactive menu to see the electronic cards.
  * It has terms and conditions.
